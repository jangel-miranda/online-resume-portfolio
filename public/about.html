<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm a HR administrator, after five years working as one, I have decided I needed winds of change, so here I am trying to return to the path I wanted to follow in the first instance.
</p>

<p>
    I'm a nature lover. I love beeing surrounded by green and my pets. I'm a dog person but I love cats as well.
</p>

<p>
    I like listening to people. Even if it's something like they know the subject very well or they just need to vent.
</p>
<p>
    Some of my hobbies are swimming, playing volleyball and crossfit, too.
